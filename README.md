# Big Integer Library

A C++11 big-integer library and optimized.

## Why would I use it?

If you need to work with large integers that maybe overflow in build-in data type size and performance is important to you - then you may find this library very useful for your work.

## Details About this library

For large number that can't fit in build-In data type size, I used a character array to store the whole number.


## This project contain two version of library

	1. First Library split into two parts, .h (header file) and .cpp (c++ file). In header file all function prototype is declared and all function defination is provided in .cpp file.

	2. Second is One Single BigInteger.cpp file. This file can be useful in programming contest when we need to work with large number. To use this file, we need to copy the whole code from this file and paste in our code.


## Operations

	1. Addition
	2. Subtraction
	3. Multiplication
